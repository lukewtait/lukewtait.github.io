    <h1>Microstates of the brain</h1>

    <h2>What are microstates?</h2>
    <p>
        The brain is highly dynamic. Even at rest, different networks of regions in the brain are rapidly activating and inactivating. 
        In fact, a handful of different "resting state networks" (RSNs) have been identified from fMRI, EEG, and MEG data (see <a href="brainimaging.html">imaging the brain</a>).
        These RSNs are groups of regions of the brain that activate and inactivate together. 
        It is hypothesised that each RSN remains active for tens to hundreds of milliseconds, before rapidly switching to a different active RSN. 
        In the EEG literature, these short, stable periods are known as <em>microstates</em> of the brain. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Because whole brain recordings at millisecond resolution are required to study microstates, typically EEG or MEG are used (although fMRI can be used to study RSN transitions at a slower time scale). 
        In fact, microstates are most commonly studied using EEG - different networks project different shaped electric fields (called the topography of the field) onto the scalp, and EEG microstate analysis typically studies the properties of these different topographies. 
        In resting state EEG, four EEG microstates have repeatably been identified, known as the canonical maps.

        For more information, a fantastic technical review of EEG microstates can be found here: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2017.11.062">Michel and Koenig (2018) NeuroImage 180:557-593</a>.

            <b>The four canonical microstate maps.</b>
            On the left, we show the four canonical microstate maps as identified in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/833244">Tait et al. (2019) bioRxiv 833244</a>. Red and blue show the strength and polarity of the electric field on the scalp (i.e. when red is positive, blue is negative and vice versa). Black circles show the locations of EEG electrodes. 
            On the right, we show that the four canonical maps have been repeatedly identified in a wide range of studies.
            The table on the right is modified from <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2017.11.062">Michel and Koenig (2018)</a> under the CC-BY licence.

    <h1>How are microstates generated in the brain?</h1>
    <p>
        This is current an open question. 
        My research aims to study this, by combining typical EEG microstate analyses with <a href="brainimaging.html">high resolution MEG and source reconstruction</a> and <a href="modelling.html">mathematical models of the brain</a>.
        Questions will involve which regions of the brain are responsible for microstate generation, and how does transitioning between states arise.

    <h2>Microstates in Alzheimer's disease</h2>
    <p>
        Since microstates are believed to be the building blocks of spontaneous conciousness, it is of interest to understand how they relate to cognition and cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease. 
        We have found that certain states related to working memory and attention are altered in Alzheimer's disease, and using a new measure we found that transitioning between states is slower and less complex (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/833244">Tait et al. (2019)</a>).
        Future will involve understanding how and why these states change in Alzheimer's disease, and whether these marker may be useful for <a href="diagnosis.html">aiding early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.</a>
