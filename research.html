    <h1>Research</h1>
    <p>
        My research interests involve the use of computational techniques such as time series analysis, graph theory, and non-linear dynamical systems to understand brain dynamics during healthy cognition and in neurodegenerative diseases. 
        My primary expertise is in Alzheimer's disease, which was the focus of my PhD thesis. 
        Particularly, I am interested in the analysis and modelling of brain dynamics recorded by functional neuroimaging modalities such as electroencephalography (EEG) or magnetoencephalography (MEG). 
        I use mathematical tools to understand networks in the brain, from the micro-scale (how do neurons work together?) to the macro-scale (how do regions of the brain work together?).
        Recently, I have focused on using microstate analysis to characterise the rapid dynamic activation and inactivation of large scale brain networks. 
    </p>

    <h2>Functional neuroimaging of the human brain</h2>
    <p>
        Most of my research revolves around studying the functional dynamics of the brain.
        When a mass of neurons within a region of the brain synchronously become active, they generate electric and magentic fields around the head. 
        MEG/EEG place sensors outside the head (MEG) or on the scalp (EEG) and record these magnetic/electric fields. 
        I am interested in using mathematical techniques to estimate the brain activity that generated these fields, called <em>source reconstruction</em>.
    </p>
    <div class="figure">
        <img src="images/source_reconstruction.png">
        <p>
            <b>Source reconstruction </b>
            is the estimation of the brain activity that generates the magnetic/electric fields recorded by M/EEG. 
        </p>
    </div>
    <p>
        There is no unique solution to source reconstruction, because there are many many more neurons in the brain (86 billion) than sensors in MEG (typically 200-300) or EEG (typically 10-300).
        This is known as an underdetermined problem, and is like asking "If A+B=10, what are A and B?".
        This question, like the source reconstruction problem, has an infinite number of solutions. 
        <a href = "https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.01.12.903302">Our recent preprint</a> has addressed how we can make a 'best estimate' of the source activity.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once we have source reconstructed the brain dynamics, it is useful to define regions of the brain to study. 
        To get the most from our data, these regions should be defined meaningfully and not just chosen at random. 
        This is often done using a map of brain regions, called an atlas.
        Probably the most detailed atlas available to date was developed by the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nature18933">Human Connectome Project</a> by looking at brain structure, function and activation during a range of tasks, and connectivity. 
        We have developed <a href="https://github.com/lukewtait/evaluate_inverse_methods/tree/master/reduced_atlas">an atlas designed for use with MEG</a> based on the Human Connectome Project's atlas.  
        This atlas is shown below on a smoothed brain surface.
    </p>
    <div class="figure">

        <p>
            <b>Our MEG optimized atlas.</b> The atlas is freely available on <a href="https://github.com/lukewtait/evaluate_inverse_methods/tree/master/reduced_atlas">Github</a>.
        </p>
    </div>


    <h2>Brain networks</h2>
    <p>
        A key research interest of mine is understanding functional networks in the brain. 
        The classical view of the brain is that different areas are responsible for different cognitive domains.
        However, integration between these processing systems is crucial for higher cognition.
        We refer to these interactions between regions as a functional brain network.
    </p>
    <p>
        To understand network, I use the mathematical field of graph theory.  
        In graph theory, a network (or <em>graph</em>) consists of a set of objects (nodes), which are connected by edges. 
        It doesn't matter what the nodes are - they can be Facebook profiles in an online social network, animals in a food web, or (masses of) neurons in a brain - 
        what is important is how nodes are connected.

            <b>What is a network?</b>
            On the left, we show a generic network structure. 
            This network consists of five nodes (black circles), and lines represent edges between the nodes. 
            On the right, we show an example network (the New York subway). 
            Here, stations (white circles) are nodes, and the train lines running between stations are the edges.

        Brain networks have been characterised on multiple spatial scales (see the figure below).
        My current research primarily focuses on large scale <em>functional</em> networks, meaning nodes are regions of the brain and edges are defined by synchronous brain activity recorded at these regions (e.g. by EEG or MEG).

    <h2>Microstates of the brain</h2>
    <p>
        There isn't just one 'functional network' which describes the brain. The brain is highly dynamic. 
        Even at rest, different functional networks in the brain are rapidly activating and inactivating. 
        In fact, a handful of different "resting state networks" (RSNs) have been identified from fMRI, EEG, and MEG data using various different methodologies. 
        It is hypothesised that each RSN remains active for tens to hundreds of milliseconds, before rapidly switching to a different active RSN.  
        These <em>'microstates'</em> of the brain are believed to be the building blocks of spontaneous conciousness, and have been nicknamed the 'atoms of thought'.
    </p>
    <p>
        My recent research has involved using microstate analysis to study dynamic functional connectivity from EEG and MEG.
        In resting state EEG, four EEG microstates have repeatedly been identified, known as the canonical microstates. 
        We have found that the canonical state related to working memory and attention are altered in Alzheimer's disease, and using a new measure of transition complexity we found that transitioning between states is slower and less complex (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/833244">Tait et al. (2019)</a>).
        My current research aims to understand the mechanisms of how and why these resting microstates are generated in the brain during healthy cognition, and why they change in neurodegenerative disorders.

            On the left, we show the four canonical microstate maps as identified in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/833244">Tait et al. (2019) bioRxiv 833244</a>. Red and blue show the strength and polarity of the electric field on the scalp (i.e. when red is positive, blue is negative and vice versa). Black circles show the locations of EEG electrodes. 
            On the right, we show that the four canonical maps have been repeatedly identified in a wide range of studies.

    <h2>Simulating the brain</h2>
    <p>
        Much of my research involves computational modelling of brain dynamics using the mathematical field of dynamical systems theory. 
        Using a virtual, simulated brain has two main advantages over a real brain.  
        Firstly, with a simulated brain, there are very few limitations on experiments which can be performed. 
        A simulated brain has no cost limitations to run (beyond the cost of a computer), whereas experiments on real participants can often be costly. 
        There are far fewer ethical limitations as no living beings are involved, meaning experiments which cannot be performed in humans or animals can be performed on a simulated brain to help understand how the brain works. 
        Furthermore, a simulated brain can be manipulated in ways that are difficult or impossible in a real brain, meaning a wider range of experiments can be performed. 
    </p>
    <p>
        A second advantage of a simulated brain is that it relies on mathematical equations. 
        Studying the equations that underpin the simulated brain activity allows us to gain deep insight into the mechanisms of how the brain functions.  
    </p>
    <p>
        Of course, there is a major disavantage to a simulated brain - it isn't a real brain! 
        In reality we can never build a perfect model of the brain, so we can never know for certain whether our simulated experiments match what we would observe in a real brain. 
        Therefore model validation against experiments is crucial.  
    </p>
    <p>
        My research has involved modelling the brain at a range of spatial scales from <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtbi.2018.04.013">single neurons</a> to <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clinph.2019.05.027">the whole brain</a>.  
        By modelling the brain at multiple spatial scales, we can gain insight into how the functional dynamics of the brain arise and the mechanisms causing altered dynamics in neurodegenerative diseases. 
        The figure below demonstrates how the brain can be modelled at different spatial scales.
        You can try running some toy models of the brain at the <a href="modelling.html">Brain Simulator</a> page, or learn how to model the brain from one of the <a href="">Workshops</a> on this website.

            <b>Modelling the brain at different scales.</b>
            In this figure, we show examples of the brain modelled at each scale. For each subfigure, on the left shows an example model output, whilst on the right shows the spatial scale. 
            (<b>A</b>) Modelling a single neuron, as presented in Tait et al. (2018)
            (<b>B</b>) Modelling a network of 21 neurons as described by Wulff et al. (2009) and replicated in Tait (2019, Doctoral Thesis). This model shows how oscillatory behaviour can arise from a network of spiking neurons, and can even couple different frequencies of oscillation (left). On the right spike times of individual neurons are shown as black dots. 
            (<b>C</b>) Modelling a neural mass. Instead of modelling many neurons wired up, equations modelling the average firing rate of the population of neurons are used instead. Whilst the model in B consisted of over 140 equations, the model in C can generate similar oscillatory behaviour yet consisted of 6 equations, making it more tractable for analysis and faster to simulate.
            (<b>D</b>) Whole brain modelling, as presented in Tait et al. (2019). The brain is split into a number of regions, and each region is simulated as a neural mass. Neural masses are connected to generate realistic patterns of synchrony between regions.
