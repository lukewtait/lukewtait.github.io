    <h1>Brain networks</h1>

    <h2>What is a network?</h2>
    <p>
        From a mathematical perspective, a network consists of two features - nodes and edges. 
        It is a set of objects (nodes), which are connected by edges. 
        When we study a network from a mathematical perspective, it doesn't matter what the nodes are - they can be Facebook profiles in a social network, animals in a food web, or neurons in a brain. 
        We are only interested in whether nodes are connected, and (in the case of a <em>weighted</em> network) strongly connected they are. 
        A well known example are railway maps, such as the London Underground or New York subway maps. 
        These are usually not a detailed map that exactly represents the locations of stations, and do not draw the stations in detail (in fact, the stations are just dots - this is a common way to draw nodes of a network). 
        What is of interest is how the stations are connected, and how long it takes to move between stations. 
        Tunnels between stations are therefore the edges of the network, and are drawn as lines between the networks. In this case, longer lines correspond to more time between stops.

            <b>What is a network?</b>
            On the left, we show a generic network structure. 
            This network consists of five nodes (black circles), and lines represent edges between the nodes. 
            On the right, we show an example network (the New York subway). 
            Here, stations (white circles) are nodes, and the train lines running between stations are the edges.

    <h2>What are brain networks?</h2>
    <p>
        The human brain consists of 86 billion neurons, which communicate through electrical activity. 
        These electrical signals are passed between neurons via structures called synapses. 
        Therefore we can consider the set of neurons as nodes, and synapses as edges. 
        This is an example of a brain network. 
        Such a huge network is often intractable to study mathematically, however, so usually we construct networks on different spatial scales depending on what scale we wish to study. 
        See the figure below for examples. 
    </p>
    <div style="max-width:1000px;">
        <img src="images/home_fc.png" style="max-height:400px">
        <p style="font-size: 9pt;">
            <b>Brain networks at multiple spatial scales.</b>
            (<b>A</b>) At the microscale, neurons are wired up through synaptic connections. Groups of neurons with similar
            properties (represented by colours in the figure), are organized in layers. 
            (<b>B</b>) At the meso-scale,
            we can consider populations of neurons with similar properties as a neural mass,
            and the connectivity between neural masses has weights dependent on the number
            and strength of connections between neurons within the population.
            (<b>C</b>)  At
            the whole brain macro-scale, we can consider different regions of the brain as
            a neural mass. The macro-scale network is the density of connections between
            regions of the brain. Figure and caption modified from Tait et al (2019) Doctoral thesis.

    <h2>What are functional brain networks?</h2>
    <p>
        Brain networks don't just have to be defined by synapses. 
        Functional brain networks use synchrony to generate a network. 
        Consider two neurons - if they fire signals at the same time, we say there is functional connectivity between these neurons. 
        By recording the activity of a group of neurons, and calculating a statistical measure of similarity between their activity, we can construct a functional brain network (see figure below). 
        Functional networks can be calculated on all the same spatial scales as the structural networks, shown in the figure above.
    </p>
    <div style="max-width:1000px;">
        <img src="images/1_NCT_construction.png" style="max-height:600px">
        <p style="font-size: 9pt;">
            <b>Functional connectivity between neurons.</b>
            This figure shows the novel method used in chapter 2 of Tait (2019) Doctoral thesis to calculate synchrony between time 
            courses of neuronal activity. In <b>A</b>, activity is recorded from a set of neurons using <a href="brainimaging.html">two-photon calcium imaging</a>.
            Red stars show times at which the neurons become active. 
            <b>B-D</b> show a method of cleaning the data get a more accurate estimation of synchrony (when one cell fires, does the other?).
            <b>E-F</b> show networks. Each column/row is a node of the network (a neuron), whilst each coloured block is the edge between a pair of neurons. 
        </p>
    </div>

    <h2>Why study brain networks?</h2>
    <p>
        Brain networks are crucial for cognition. 
        The classical view of the brain is that different areas are responsible for different cognitive processes - for example, there is a part of the brain responsible for vision (the visual cortex) and a part responsible for movement (the motor cortex).
        But now consider walking down the street. 
        Some communication is required between vision and movement so that we don't walk into a lampost. 
        For all higher cognitive processes, integration between the brain's processing systems is crucial. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Using network science to study the brain can also help us understand why and how it is connected. 
        For example, there is a measure in network science called "global efficiency". 
        An network with high global efficiency is very fast for transporting information, without being densly wired up (i.e. it is structured efficiently). 
        This is simple to picture with the idea of the London Underground again - 
        an efficient rail line should let you quickly move between all stations, 
        but it is highly inefficient to build a direct line between every pair of stations. 
        The same can be said of the brain - if one part of the brain needs to communicate with another, it should be able to do so rapidly, 
        but without the requirement to fit an extremely large number of synapses in the head.
        In Alzheimer's disease, where cognitive decline is observed, the global efficiency of the brain network is reduced (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1388245719309022">Tait et al. 2019</a>).
        Another example from my research is shown below. 
    </p>
    <div style="max-width:1000px;">
        <img src="images/network_cognition.png" style="max-height:400px">
        <p style="font-size: 9pt;">
            <b>Network science can help explain cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease.</b>
            In <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1388245719309022">Tait et al. (2019)</a>, we studied the network substrates of cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease. 
            We calculated functional networks, and used network science to study the networks. 
            We found the temporal lobes, which are a language centre of the brain, became disconnected in people with Alzheimer's disease.
            In the people with Alzheimer's disease, the degree of disconnection directly correlated with reduced cognitive test scores 
            (using the mini-mental state exam, MMSE), and particularly the language score. 
            Hence, network science applied to brain networks has shown how disruption to the language network is related to cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease.
