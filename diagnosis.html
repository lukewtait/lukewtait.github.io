    <h1>Diagnosing Alzheimer's disease</h1>

    <h2>What is Alzheimer's disease?</h2>
    <p>
        Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurological disorder characterised by a progressive decline in cognitive facilities, including memory impairments, difficulties with language, and disorientation to space and time. 
        There is no cure for AD, and since 2015 AD and dementia have been the <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/bulletins/deathsregistrationsummarytables/2018">leading cause of death in England and Wales</a>. 
    </p>
    <p>
        In AD, two harmful pathologies are found in the brain. These are known as amyloid-beta, which form "plaques" outside of neurons, and tau, which form "tangles" inside neurons. 
        Neurons in the brain progressively die, and this causes a phenomenon known as atrophy - a shrinking of the volume of the brain. 
        Staging of amyloid-beta, tau, and atrophy are shown in the figure below. 
    </p>
    <div style="max-width:1000px;">
        <img src="images/ADstaging.png" style="max-height:500px; max-width:1000px;">
    </div>

    <h2>Why EEG?</h2>
    <p>
        An early diagnosis of AD has <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jalz.2018.02.001">many benefits</a>, including more effective treatment and the ability to financially prepare. 
        However, at the present time, diagnosis of AD is made based on symptoms, and yet the actual disease may start <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05718-5">years before symptoms begin</a>.
        Therefore development of new tools for diagnosis of AD as early as possible that is not based on symptoms is crucial.
    </p>
    <p>
        EEG is an exciting potential candidate for such a tool.
        It <a href="brainimaging.html">measures brain activity</a>, which has been demonstrated to <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/36011"> change in people at risk of Alzheimer's disease before symptoms arise</a>. 
        EEG is much cheaper than other brain imaging modalities such as MRI, and is currently widely implemented in healthcare systems across the globe for diagnosing epilepsy. 
        Finally, it is completely non-invasive, meaning it does not require any surgery, and so is potentially useful for screeing large populations for AD.
    </p> 

    <h2>The AlzSM Project</h2>
    <p>
        The AlzSM project is an international collaboration between universities in the South West of England and Wales and the State Hospital of San Marino. 
        Psychologists, clinicians, mathematicians, and physicists are all working together to record and analyse the EEG of people living with Alzheimer's disease. 
        The aim of AlzSM is to develop new EEG based tools to aid with early diagnosis of AD. 
        At the present stage, we have developed <a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/833244">a new method</a> based on <a href="microstates.html">EEG microstates</a> which seems successful.
        Our tool could differentiate between healthy people and people with Alzheimer's disease (a few days after diagnosis) correctly 85% of the time based only on the EEG. 
        This level of accuracy didn't depend on where people were from - it was the same for two independent data sets recorded from people in England and people in San Marino. 
        Even more exciting, it could predict whether someone with mild cognitive impairment is likely to progress to Alzheimer's disease within 4 years with just as high accuracy. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The steps to developing the EEG marker of Alzheimer's disease are shown in the figure below. 
        The next steps are testing on a larger cohort, and making steps toward using this tool in a clinic. 
    </p>

            <b>Development and testing of tools for diagnosis AD from the EEG, as described in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/833244">Tait et al (2019)</a>.</b>
            (<b>A</b>) Starting with a single cohort of people with AD and healthy controls ("Training data"), we can select features of the EEG we wish to study and train a machine learning model to diagnose AD. We can test the model using a method called cross-validation, which is used to check the model is robust to new participants. 
            (<b>B</b>) The next step is to test the model on a new set of participants ("Test data"). 
            (<b>C</b>) Hopefully in steps A and B we find that the model is useful for separating people with AD from healthy controls, but is it useful for early diagnosis? E.g. before a Doctor can make a diagnosis based on symptoms? To test this, we used EEG from people with mild cognitive impairment, for whom the Doctor could not state whether they would eventually get AD. By putting these participants into our model, we will get a prediction of "AD" or "not AD". We then wait four years, and compare our model's predictions against whether or not the patient truly developed AD. In more than 90% of cases, the model was correct.
